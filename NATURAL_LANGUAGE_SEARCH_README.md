# Natural Language Search Feature Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a powerful natural language search feature to the Loopn chat application, allowing users to find potential connections using conversational queries like:

- "Find me a co-founder"
- "Software engineer in AI"
- "Someone with startup experience"
- "I want to meet someone interesting"

## Architecture

### AWS Services Used

- **Amazon Bedrock**: Titan Text Embeddings v2 for generating vector embeddings (most cost-effective)
- **DynamoDB**: Storing embeddings alongside user profiles (no additional vector database needed)
- **AWS Lambda**: Processing search queries and generating embeddings
- **AWS Amplify Gen 2**: Full-stack integration and deployment

### Key Components

#### 1. Backend Infrastructure

- **Vector Search Lambda Function** (`/amplify/functions/vector-search/`)
  - Generates embeddings using Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2
  - Performs similarity search using cosine similarity
  - Handles user profile indexing
  - Supports bulk operations for existing users

#### 2. Database Schema Updates

- Added `profileEmbedding` field to UserProfile table
- Added `embeddingLastUpdated` timestamp
- Automatic indexing when profiles are created/updated

#### 3. Frontend Components

- **SearchResults Component**: Displays natural language search results
- **Enhanced SearchUser Component**: Integrated with vector search
- **Vector Search Service**: Client-side service for API interactions

#### 4. Admin Panel

- **Vector Search Admin Page** (`/admin/vector-search`)
  - Bulk index existing users
  - Check indexing status
  - Test search functionality

## Features

### 1. Natural Language Understanding

- Converts natural language queries into vector embeddings
- Semantic matching finds relevant users based on meaning, not just keywords
- Handles various query styles and intentions

### 2. Real-time Search Results

- Search-as-you-type functionality
- Debounced queries for performance
- Similarity scoring (0-100% match)

### 3. Automatic Indexing

- New user profiles automatically indexed
- Profile updates trigger re-indexing
- Bulk indexing utility for existing users

### 4. Privacy-First Design

- Only indexes public profile information (excludes email, name)
- Uses job role, company, industry, skills, interests, and about sections
- Respects user privacy while enabling discovery

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

#### 1. Deploy the Infrastructure

```bash
cd amplify
npm install
cd functions/vector-search
npm install
cd ../..
npx amplify deploy
```

#### 2. Index Existing Users

1. Navigate to `/admin/vector-search`
2. Click "Check Status" to see current indexing state
3. Click "Index All Existing Users" to bulk index profiles
4. Wait for the process to complete

#### 3. Test the Feature

1. Use the search box on the main dashboard
2. Enter natural language queries
3. View results with similarity scores
4. Test with queries like:
   - "software engineer"
   - "startup founder"
   - "someone with marketing experience"

### For Users

#### 1. Search for Connections

- Go to the main dashboard
- Type your query in the search box
- Results appear as you type (minimum 3 characters)
- View similarity percentages for each match

#### 2. Connect with Results

- Click "Connect" on any search result
- Send chat requests to interesting matches
- Use the same flow as regular user connections

## Technical Details

### Embedding Model

- **Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2**: Most cost-effective option
- **Dimensions**: 1024-dimensional vectors
- **Cost**: ~$0.0001 per 1K input tokens

### Similarity Algorithm

- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between vectors
- **Scoring**: Normalized to 0-100% for user-friendly display
- **Threshold**: No minimum threshold (shows all results ranked by relevance)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Debounced Search**: 500ms delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Batch Indexing**: Processes users in groups of 10
- **Lazy Loading**: Results load progressively
- **Caching**: DynamoDB provides fast retrieval

### Security & Privacy

- **Authenticated Access**: Only logged-in users can search
- **Profile Privacy**: Uses only public profile information
- **Admin Access**: Restricted to authorized administrators

## Cost Estimation

### Monthly Costs (for 1000 active users)

- **Bedrock Embeddings**: ~$5-10/month (depending on search volume)
- **Lambda Execution**: ~$1-2/month
- **DynamoDB Storage**: Minimal (embeddings stored in existing table)
- **Total**: ~$6-12/month for 1000 users

### Cost Optimization

- Uses cheapest embedding model (Titan v2)
- No separate vector database needed
- Efficient similarity calculations in-memory
- Batch operations reduce API calls

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Search Query Volume**: Track usage patterns
- **Embedding Generation Costs**: Monitor Bedrock usage
- **Search Latency**: Ensure fast response times
- **Indexing Success Rate**: Monitor bulk operations

### Maintenance Tasks

- **Regular Re-indexing**: As profiles change significantly
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjust batch sizes if needed
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track AWS service usage

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features

- **Improved Relevance**: Machine learning ranking
- **Search Filters**: Industry, experience level, location
- **Saved Searches**: Allow users to save frequent queries
- **Search Analytics**: Track popular search terms

### Advanced Features

- **Multi-modal Search**: Include profile pictures in matching
- **Conversation Starters**: AI-generated ice breakers
- **Group Discovery**: Find communities of similar professionals

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Search Returns No Results

- Check if users have been indexed (admin panel)
- Verify Bedrock permissions are correctly set
- Ensure Lambda function has DynamoDB access

#### 2. Slow Search Performance

- Check DynamoDB read capacity
- Monitor Lambda function timeout settings
- Verify network connectivity to AWS services

#### 3. Indexing Failures

- Check CloudWatch logs for error details
- Verify Bedrock model access in the region
- Ensure proper IAM permissions

### Logs & Debugging

- **Lambda Logs**: CloudWatch Logs for vector-search function
- **API Errors**: Check browser network tab for API failures
- **DynamoDB Metrics**: Monitor read/write capacity usage

## Support

For technical issues or questions:

1. Check CloudWatch logs for error details
2. Use the admin panel to verify system status
3. Test with simple queries first (e.g., "engineer")
4. Verify AWS service limits haven't been exceeded
